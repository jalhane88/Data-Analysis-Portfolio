### How to Navigate This Repository

*   The `utils/` directory contains reusable Python scripts for common tasks like initial data reporting (`eda_utils.py`) and model evaluation (`ml_utils.py`).
*   Each project folder is self-contained and includes a `README.md` with a summary, the raw Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`), a clean HTML report, and any necessary data files (or instructions on how to acquire them).
*   A consolidated list of all Python libraries used is in the `requirements.txt` file.
